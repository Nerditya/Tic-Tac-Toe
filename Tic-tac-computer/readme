Basic idea - 
Simply used a while loop 
used a string to store the current data of game 
created a bool gameon to check if the game is still on 
each time took input from the user and marked it accordingly
have put if conditions to check if game has come to an end 
have used random to generate a random number from 0 to 9 and then made computer play it
